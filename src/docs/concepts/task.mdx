Addon modules often need to leverage async helpers from libuv as part of their implementation. This allows them to schedule work to be executed asynchronously so that their methods can return in advance of the work being completed. This allows them to avoid blocking overall execution of the Node.js application.

You can use `Env::spawn` to spawn a defined `Task` into libuv thead pool. See example in [Reference](./ref).

Expect `compute` and `resolve`, you can also provide `reject` method to do some clean up when `Task` ran into error, like `unref` some object:

```rust
struct CountBufferLength {
  data: Ref<JsBufferValue>,
}

impl CountBufferLength {
  pub fn new(data: Ref<JsBufferValue>) -> Self {
    Self { data }
  }
}

impl Task for CountBufferLength {
  type Output = usize;
  type JsValue = JsNumber;

  fn compute(&mut self) -> Result<Self::Output> {
    if self.data.len() == 10 {
      return Err(Error::from_reason("len can't be 5".to_string()));
    }
    Ok((&self.data).len())
  }

  fn resolve(self, env: Env, output: Self::Output) -> Result<Self::JsValue> {
    self.data.unref(env)?;
    env.create_uint32(output as _)
  }

  fn reject(self, env: Env, err: Error) -> Result<Self::JsValue> {
    self.data.unref(env)?;
    Err(err)
  }
}
```
