# Announcing NAPI-RS v3

> 🦀 NAPI-RS v3 - WebAssembly! Safer API design and new cross compilation features.
>
> 📅 2025/07/07

It has been 4 years since the release of **NAPI-RS** V2. During this time, the **NAPI-RS** community has been developing rapidly. We have identified many problems with the API design in the community. For example, `ThreadsafeFunction` has always been difficult to use. The main reason is that Node-API's ThreadsafeFunction is designed too complexly, which causes the Rust encapsulation to leak too much of the underlying complexity. However, through collaboration with the <img src={rolldownLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> [`Rolldown`](https://github.com/rolldown/rolldown) and <img src={rspackLogo.src} style={{ marginBottom: '3px' }} width={20} height={20} /> [`Rspack`](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspack) teams, we have finally found a design that can balance API complexity and correctness.

`WebAssembly` is the biggest update this time. In V3, you can compile your project into `WebAssembly` with almost no code changes. If the compilation target is `wasm32-wasip1-threads` or higher, you can directly run code that uses Rust features like `std::thread` and `tokio` in the browser without any additional modifications.

Cross compilation is also a big update. In previous versions, you need to use <NodeLink href="https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/pkgs/container/napi-rs%2Fnodejs-rust/326314378?tag=lts-debian-aarch64">`nodejs-rust:lts-debian`</NodeLink> or <NodeLink href="https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/pkgs/container/napi-rs%2Fnodejs-rust/326314378?tag=lts-debian-aarch64">`nodejs-rust:lts-debian-aarch64`</NodeLink> docker images to build your project. These images are huge, it slows down the CI build time, and it's hard to sync the tools and infrastructure with the community.

Now let's dive into the new features of V3.

## `WebAssembly`

Supporting `WebAssembly` means a lot for the **NAPI-RS** community. There are several scenarios that only `WebAssembly` can handle:

1. Provides the playground and reproducible environment in the browser, like [Rolldown repl](https://repl.rolldown.rs/) and [Oxc playground](https://playground.oxc.rs/).
2. Provides fallback packages for platforms that don't have pre-built binaries. For some projects, it's hard to maintain pre-built binaries for all possible platforms.
3. Make the project usable in [`StackBlitz`](https://stackblitz.com/).

### Why don't use [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) instead

One of the main reasons is that you don't need to write 2 different bindings for the same project.

For example, the [Oxc project maintained a `wasm-bindgen` binding](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc/blob/oxlint_v0.15.0/crates/oxc_wasm/src/lib.rs) before. However, as the project grew larger, the APIs gradually increased, and the maintenance cost became higher and higher. It was often necessary to port the same logic from the Node.js binding to the `wasm-bindgen` binding.

Besides that, using `wasm-bindgen` has many limitations, such as the inability to use `std::thread` and third-party libraries that depend on `std::thread`. For example, you may need to write code like:

```rust
#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
use rayon::prelude::*;

...

#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]
const hash = entries.par_iter().map(|chunk| chunk.compute_hash()).collect::<Vec<_>>();

#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
const hash = entries.iter().map(|chunk| chunk.compute_hash()).collect::<Vec<_>>();

...
```

With **NAPI-RS**, you can compile the codes and run them without pain.

Another pain point is if you are using crates written in `C` or `C++`, setting up the `wasm-bindgen` build process is very complex. See:

<LinkPreview href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/2209" />

See [**WebAssembly**](/docs/concepts/webassembly) for more details.

### Sample App using **NAPI-RS** WebAssembly

This is a sample app using **NAPI-RS** WebAssembly. You can transform the image to `webp` `jpeg` or `avif` with different quality.

<Callout type="info">
  The `webp` feature is coming from the
  [`libwebp-sys`](https://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys) crate. It's using the
  [`libwebp`](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp) under the hood. The
  `libwebp` is a C library, but you can feel free to use it in **NAPI-RS**
  project, and build it into `WebAssembly` without any additional modifications.
</Callout>

<TransformImage />

## `API Improvements`

There are a lot of improvements in the API design, both usability and security have been improved.

### `lifetime`

The lifetime is introduced in **NAPI-RS** V3, see [**Understanding Lifetime**](/docs/concepts/understanding-lifetime) for more details.

In **V2**, due to the complexity of designing codegen and APIs, we didn't have time to add lifetimes to the APIs, which led to some issues.

1. Some types have safety issues, such as the previous `JsObject`, which could escape and be used outside the scope of `#[napi] fn` calls, when in fact its underlying `napi_value` had already become invalid. We can now constrain such behavior using Rust's lifetimes
2. `#[napi] struct` previously couldn't contain lifetimes, which caused some usability issues

**For example**:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use napi::bindgen_prelude::*;
use napi_derive::napi;

#[napi]
pub fn promise_finally_callback(mut promise: PromiseRaw<()>, config: Object) -> Result<()> {
  // ❌ compile Error
  // borrowed data escapes outside of function
  // `config` escapes the function body here
  // lib.rs(5, 62): `config` is a reference that is only valid in the function body
  // lib.rs(5, 62): has type `napi::bindgen_prelude::Object<'1>`
  // borrowed data escapes outside of function argument requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`
  promise.finally(|env| {
    let on_finally = config.get_named_property::<Function<(), ()>>("on_finally")?;
    Ok(())
  })?;
  Ok(())
}
```

There is `Reference` API for this case in **V3**, you can see [**JavaScript Value Reference**](/docs/concepts/reference#javascript-value-reference) for more details.

### `ThreadsafeFunction`

`ThreadsafeFunction` has been redesigned in **V3**. In previous versions, the API of `ThreadsafeFunction` is too low level, and it's not safe at all.
In the new API, we have hidden Node-API concepts such as `ref` `unref`, and `acquire` `release`, using ownership to encapsulate these APIs, and prohibiting lifecycle management using the underlying ref count model.

If you want to pass `ThreadsafeFunction` to different threads, we now allow using `std::sync::Arc` to achieve this.

```rust {10} filename="lib.rs"
use std::sync::Arc;

use napi::{
  bindgen_prelude::*,
  threadsafe_function::{ThreadsafeFunction, ThreadsafeFunctionCallMode},
};
use napi_derive::napi;

#[napi]
pub fn pass_threadsafe_function(tsf: Arc<ThreadsafeFunction<u32, u32>>) -> Result<()> {
  for i in 0..100 {
    let tsf = tsf.clone();
    std::thread::spawn(move || {
      tsf.call(Ok(i), ThreadsafeFunctionCallMode::NonBlocking);
    });
  }
  Ok(())
}
```

TypeScript type generation for `ThreadsafeFunction` has also been improved, you can only generate `(...args: any[]) => any` type in the previous version, but since **V3** defines the `FnArgs` and `Return` types in the generic, you can now generate the correct type for `ThreadsafeFunction`.

The example above will generate the following TypeScript type:

```ts filename="index.d.ts"
export declare function passThreadsafeFunction(
  tsf: (err: Error | null, arg: number) => number,
): void
```

### `Function`

Like the `ThreadsafeFunction` API, the `Function` has also been redesigned in **V3**.

The `JsFunction` API is deprecated in **V3**, the new `Function` API can generate the correct TypeScript types, more safety and easier to use.

**For example**:

```rust filename="lib.rs"
use napi::bindgen_prelude::*;
use napi_derive::napi;

#[napi]
pub fn call_function(callback: Function<u32, u32>) -> Result<u32> {
  callback.call(1)
}
```

⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️

```ts filename="index.d.ts"
export declare function callFunction(callback: (arg: number) => number): number
```

For more details you can see [**Function**](/docs/concepts/function).

## `Cross Compilation`

Cross compilation is painful for the **Rust** community. There is the [`rust-cross`](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) project, but it's not easy to use:

1. The `GLIBC` version for GNU Linux distributions is too new, for example `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` only supports `GLIBC 2.31`.
2. Configuring compilation for the older `GLIBC 2.17` (still a version that many enterprises need to support) is very complex.
3. Runs on `QEMU` and Docker, which is slow and limited.

**NAPI-RS** V3 introduces a new cross compilation feature, with the `napi build --use-napi-cross` flag, this is the supports matrix for the cross compilation:

| Target/Host                   | x86_64 | arm64 |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu      | ✅     | ✅    |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu     | ✅     | ✅    |
| armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf | ✅     | ✅    |
| powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu | ✅     | ✅    |
| s390x-unknown-linux-gnu       | ✅     | ✅    |

All these targets are supported to **GLIBC 2.17**.

This is the repo for the cross toolchain. We basically extract the necessary tools and files from the [`manylinux-cross`](https://github.com/rust-cross/manylinux-cross) project, then upload them to the `npm` registry. The `@napi-rs/cli` will then pick the correct toolchain and inject environment variables into the build process.

<LinkPreview href="https://github.com/napi-rs/cross-toolchain" />

We also integrate `cargo-zigbuild` and `cargo-xwin` in the `@napi-rs/cli`, so you can build many different targets on a single machine. See [**Cross Compilation**](/docs/cross-build) for more details.

## `Brand new pnpm package template`
We have supported **yarn** as the package manager for the [`package-template`](https://github.com/napi-rs/package-template) project since **V2**, because yarn's [supportedArchitectures](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#supportedArchitectures) feature is very friendly to cross-platform compilation and testing, and it has good Docker support.

As `pnpm` becomes popular, we also support [package-template-pnpm](https://github.com/napi-rs/package-template-pnpm) in **V3**.

### **Why there is no `npm` package template?**

Because of this issue:

<LinkPreview href="https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828" />

The `npm` team spent several years resolving this critical issue for native addons, although the issue itself wasn't complex. While this issue has been fixed in `npm` 11, the Node.js team encountered other problems when upgrading to `npm` 11, resulting in both `Node.js` LTS versions and default Docker images still using `npm` 10, which contains this bug.

<Callout type="info">
  From this issue, we can see that the `npm` team does not prioritize native addon scenarios, so currently **NAPI-RS** neither supports nor recommends using `npm` as a package manager. It's hard to say whether the `npm` team will fix similar critical issues in a timely manner in the future.
</Callout>

## `@napi-rs/cli` API

You can now easily integrate the **NAPI-RS** tools into your JavaScript infra:

```ts
// Programmatically
import { NapiCli } from '@napi-rs/cli'

const cli = new NapiCli()

const { task, abort } = await cli.build({
  release: true,
  features: ['allocator-api'],
  esm: true,
  platform: true,
})

const outputs = await task
```

All napi commands have corresponding APIs, you can visit [`cli`](/docs/cli/build) to learn more.

## Community is growing fast!

When **V2** was released, only [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [SWC](https://swc.rs/) were using **NAPI-RS**.

Today, **NAPI-RS** has been widely used in developing various types of applications.

<a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank"><img style={{ marginBottom: '2px' }} src={cursorLogo.src} width={24} height={24} /></a> [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) is using **NAPI-RS** to build their Desktop and Node.js server high performance addons.

<a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank"><TailwindLogo /></a> is using **NAPI-RS** to build their `oxide` high performance engine. Tailwind CSS is also one of our platinum sponsors!

<a href="https://affine.pro/" target="_blank"><AffineLogo /></a> is using **NAPI-RS** for their Electron Desktop App and Node.js server high performance addons.

<a href="https://bitwarden.com/" target="_blank"><BitwardenLogo /></a> is using **NAPI-RS** to build their Electron Desktop App and Node.js server high performance addons.

At the same time, with the rise of AI, **NAPI-RS** has also begun participating in the development of AI tools. For example, <a href="https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb" target="_blank"><LanceDBLogo /></a> is a vector database that uses **NAPI-RS** to provide a Node.js embedded experience; <a href="https://www.trychroma.com/" target="_blank"><img src={chromaLogo.src} alt="Chroma" width={28} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} /> **Chroma**</a> is an open-source search and retrieval database for AI applications. [Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) is a tokenizer library developed by <a href="https://huggingface.co/" target="_blank"><img src={huggingfaceLogo.src} style={{ marginBottom: '2px' }} width={20} height={20} /> **Hugging Face**</a>. <a href="https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero" target="_blank"> <img src={tensorzeroLogo.src} style={{ marginBottom: '2px' }} width={20} height={20} /> TensorZero </a> is an open-source stack for industrial-grade LLM applications, they also use **NAPI-RS** to build their `tensorzero-node` client.

In the frontend build field, **NAPI-RS** has been widely used. Almost all Bundler use **NAPI-RS** to improve their performance:

- <a href="https://rolldown.rs/"><img src={rolldownLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> Rolldown </a>
- <a href="https://rollupjs.org/"><img src={rollupLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> Rollup </a>
- <a href="https://rspack.dev/"><img src={rspackLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> Rspack </a>
- <a href="https://parceljs.org/"><img src={parcelLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> Parcel </a>

**Monorepo tools:**
- <a href="https://turbo.build/"><TurborepoLogo /></a>
- <a href="https://nx.dev/"><NxLogo style={{ margin: '0 0 3px 2px' }} /> Nx</a>

And <a href="https://oxc.rs/"><img src={oxcLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> Oxc</a> provides Linter, Transformer and all kinds of apis via **NAPI-RS**.

<TsLogo /> TypeScript team is exploring to use **NAPI-RS** to build API layer for the [`typescript-go`](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go) project.

<br/>

<LinkPreview href="https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/455" />

<a href="https://deno.com/"><DenoLogo /></a> and <a href="https://bun.sh/"><img src={bunLogo.src} style={{ verticalAlign: 'text-bottom' }} width={20} height={20} /> **Bun**</a> have improved their <NodeLink href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html"> **Node-API** </NodeLink> compatibility, so almost all **NAPI-RS** projects can run in **Deno** and **Bun**.
