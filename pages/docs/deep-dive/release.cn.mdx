# Release native packages

{/* 从前面部分的介绍可以窥见，目前社区上主流的分发方式是直接分发 `C/C++` 源码。但这种方式对于使用 Rust 编写 Node.js native addon 的开发者来说，并不是一种可以接受的分发方案，因为 Rust 工具链的复杂性和编译耗时等问题，分直接发源码对使用这些 native addon 的开发者来说会是一种巨大的折磨。 */}

As you can see from the previous section, the dominant distribution method on the community is **_distribute `C/C++` source code directly_**. However, this approach is not an acceptable distribution solution for developers using `Rust` to write Node.js native addons, because the complexity and compilation time of the Rust toolchain makes distributing the source code directly a huge ordeal for developers using these native addons.

{/* 下面我将介绍包括***分发源码***在内的 native addon 的几种分发方式，在介绍完之后相信你能找到最适合 `Rust` 的 native addon 分发方式。 */}

Next I will describe several ways of distributing native addon including **_distribute source code directly_**. After this introduction, I believe you can find the most suitable native addon distribution for `Rust`.

## 1. Distribute source code

Using this approach requires the user to install build tools such as `node-gyp`, `cmake`, `g++`, etc. This is not a problem during the development phase, but with the popularity of `Docker`, installing a bunch of build toolchains in a given `Docker` environment is a nightmare for many teams. And if this problem is not handled well, it will increase the size of the `Docker image` for no reason (actually this problem can be solved by building the Docker image in a special Builder image before compiling it, but I have talked to various companies and few teams will do this).

## 2. Distribute only JavaScript code, download the corresponding product in `postinstall` phase

Some native addon build dependencies are so complex that it's not practical for the average Node developer to install a full set of build tools during the development phase. Another scenario is that the native addon itself is so complex that it can take a lot of time to compile, and the library author wouldn't want people to spend hours just installing it when using his library.

So another popular way is to use the `CI` tools to **_precompile_** the native addon in the `CI` task for each platform (win32/darwin/linux/...) and distribute only the corresponding JavaScript code, while the **_precompiled_** addon file is downloaded from the **CDN/GitHub release** via the `postinstall` script. For example, there is a popular tool in the community that does this: [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp). This tool automatically uploads the native addon compiled in `CI` to a specific location based on the user's configuration, and then downloads it from the upload location during installation.

This distribution method seems flawless, but there are several problems that can't be circumvented:

- Tools such as `node-pre-gyp` will add a lot of **runtime irrelevant** dependencies to a project.
- No matter which `CDN` you upload to, it's hard to accommodate users from all over the world. Do you recall the painful memories of being stuck in `postinstall` for hours to download files from some GitHub release and then failing? It's true that building a binary mirror in the nearest region can partially alleviate this problem, but mirror is not synchronized/missing from time to time.
- Not friendly to private networks. Many companies may not be able to access the extranet on their CI/CD machines (they will have a private NPM to go along with it, but if they don't there is no point in discussing it), let alone downloading native addon from some CDN.

## 3. The native addon for different platforms is distributed through different npm packages

The new generation build tool [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), which is very popular on the front-end, uses this approach. Each native addon corresponds to an npm package, and then the `postinstall` script installs the native addon package for the current system.

Another way is to expose the packages to be installed by the user, use all native packages as `optionalDependencies`, and then use the `os` and `cpu` fields in `package.json` to have `npm/yarn/pnpm` automatically select them during _automatically choose which native package to install (which actually fails if it doesn't match the system requirements)_ when installing, e.g.:

```json
{
  "name": "@node-rs/bcrypt",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "os": ["linux", "win32", "darwin"],
  "cpu": ["x64"],
  "optionalDependencies": {
    "@node-rs/bcrypt-darwin": "^0.5.0",
    "@node-rs/bcrypt-linux": "^0.5.0",
    "@node-rs/bcrypt-win32": "^0.5.0"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "@node-rs/bcrypt-darwin",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "os": ["darwin"],
  "cpu": ["x64"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "@node-rs/bcrypt-linux",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "os": ["linux"],
  "cpu": ["x64"]
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "@node-rs/bcrypt-win32",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "os": ["win32"],
  "cpu": ["x64"]
}
```

This approach is the least intrusive distribution for users using native addon, and is used by [@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg](https://github.com/kribblo/node-ffmpeg-installer#readme).

However, this approach imposes an additional workload on the native addon authors, including the need to write tools to manage the release binary and a bunch of packages, which are generally very difficult to debug (and typically span several systems and CPU architectures).

These tools need to manage the entire addon flow through the development -> local release version -> CI -> artifacts -> deploy phase. On top of that, there are a lot of CI/CD configurations to write/debug, which is time consuming and tedious.

## Conclusion

The native addon with the 3rd distribution method (**distribution of native addons for different platforms via different npm packages**) is the easiest to use and the least mentally taxing for the developers who use it, but this distribution method imposes additional maintenance costs on the native addon authors.

Later we will describe how `napi-rs` can help native addon developers solve the problem of high CI/CD maintenance costs with this distribution.

{/* 采用第 3 种分发方式(**不同平台的 native addon 通过不同的 npm package 分发**)的 native addon 是最易用的，对于使用这个 native addon 的开发者来说他们的心智负担最小，但这种分发方式会给 native addon 的作者带来额外的维护成本。后面的内容我们会介绍 `napi-rs` 如何在这种分发方式下帮 native addon 的开发者们解决 CI/CD 维护成本比较高的问题。 */}
