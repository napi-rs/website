## The Feudal era: Using `v8 C++` headers directly

In very early ages, developers were using `v8/Node C++` headers directly to build Node.js native addon.

```cpp
Handle<Value> Echo(const Arguments& args)
{
    HandleScope scope;

    if(args.Length() < 1)
    {
        ThrowException(
            Exception::TypeError(
                String::New("Wrong number of arguments.")));
        return scope.Close(Undefined());
    }

    return scope.Close(args[0]);
}

void Init(Handle<Object> exports)
{
    exports->Set(String::NewSymbol("echo"),
        FunctionTemplate::New(Echo)->GetFunction());
}
```

This code snippets defined a simple Node.js function: `echo`. It always return the first argument passed in. And it equals to this simple `Node.js` codes:

```js
exports.echo = function () {
  if (arguments.length < 1) throw new Error('Wrong number of arguments.')
  return arguments[0]
}
```

If you publish these codes as a `npm` package, it can only work with `node 0.10.x`.

But why? The short answer is **_v8 and Node.js API's change fast._** For example in `Node.js 6.x`, the way of define `JsFunction` changed:

```cpp
Handle<Value> Echo(const Arguments& args);    // 0.10.x
void Echo(FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args); // 6.x
```

So native packages developed in this way can only support only few versions of Node.js, when the API of `v8` or `Node.js` changed, these packages couldn't be compiled any more. And if maintainers updated the API to latest Node.js and `v8`, the package couldn't be compiled under the older Node.js, again.

## The Castle era: Native Abstractions for Node.js

Back to 2013, with the fast iteration of the `Node.js` and `v8`, packages used the old way to build native addon grow with pains. And [`NAN`](https://github.com/nodejs/nan) came out. It's shorten for **Native Abstractions for Node.js**.

> NAN was built by [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) and then [Benjamin Byholm](https://github.com/kkoopa). NAN was belong to Rod Vaggs' GitHub account from the beginning, and transferred to `io.js` organization in the dark age of `Node.js` split to `io.js` and `Node.js`；After they got back together，NAN finally transferred into `Node.js` organization.

After NAN came out, the develop experience in native addon packages came to **_the Castle age_**, and last to nowadays.

It's still a litter abstract for the full description of NAN: **_Native abstractions for Node.js_**. To be specifically, it's a bunch of **_C macros_**. You can define a JavaScript function like this for example:

```cpp
NAN_METHOD(Echo)
{
}
```

The macro of NAN will be expanded to different CPP codes in during compiling according different Node.js version:

```cpp
Handle<Value> Echo(const Arguments& args);    // 0.10.x
void Echo(FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args); // 6.x
```

`NAN_METHOD` will be expanded by NAN to the codes snippets below.

There are tons of macros in NAN rather than `NAN_METHOD`, developers can using it to do almost anything.

For example the `Nan::HandleScope` allow you to declare **_handle scope_**, `Nan::AsyncWorker` allow you to spawn task on `libuv`.

So in the **The Castle age**, here is what the `c++` native addon look like:

```cpp
NAN_METHOD(Echo)
{
    if(info.Length() < 1)
    {
        Nan::ThrowError("Wrong number of arguments.");
        return info.GetReturnValue().Set(Nan::Undefined());
    }

    info.GetReturnValue().Set(info[0]);
}

NAN_MODULE_INIT(InitAll)
{
    Nan::Set(
        target,
        Nan::New<String>("echo").ToLocalChecked(),
        Nan::GetFunction(Nan::New<v8::FunctionTemplate>(Echo)).ToLocalChecked());
}
```

The benefit of writing codes in this way is because the codes could auto upgrade with the NAN upgraded, the codes could be compatible with every versions of Node.js.

> Even a good thing like the NAN has a mission, and anything outside of that mission will be gradually stripped away. Versions such as 0.10.x and 0.12.x, for example, should be retired, and the NAN will gradually drop compatibility and support for them.

## Age of Empires: ABI-compliant N-API

Since the release of Node.js v8.0.0, Node.js has introduced a brand new interface for developing C++ native modules, **N-API**.

> According to the official documentation, it is pronounced with a single N, plus API, which means that the four English letters are pronounced separately.

How does this differ from the previous three eras? Why would it be a further age of empire?

First of all, we know that even under NAN development, code written once needs to be recompiled under different versions of Node.js, otherwise Node.js won't load a C++ extension properly if the versions don't match. In other words, write once, compile everywhere.

N-API, as compared to NAN, black-boxes all the underlying data structures of Node.js and abstracts them into the interface of N-API.

Different versions of Node.js use the same interface, which is stably ABI-compatible, that is, the Application Binary Interface (ABI). This allows compiled C++ extensions to be used directly without recompilation, as long as the ABI version number is the same across Node.js versions. In fact, Node.js that supports the N-API interface does specify the current ABI version used by Node.js.

In order to achieve the hidden goal above, the posture of using N-API looks like this:

- Provide the header file `node_api.h`.
- Any N-API call returns a `napi_status` enum to indicate whether the call was successful or not.
- The return value of N-API is occupied by `napi_status`, so the real return value is inherited from the incoming arguments.
- All JavaScript datatypes are wrapped in the black box type `napi_value`, no longer types like `v8::Object`, `v8::Number`, and so on.
- If the function call is unsuccessful, the `napi_get_last_error_info` function can be used to get information about the last error.

For more details about functions of N-API, visit its <NodeLink href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html">documentation</NodeLink>, but for now, let's take a look at something a little less abstract to give you an impression of N-API.

### Module initialization

In the **_Feudal_** and NAN eras, module initialization was left to the macros supplied by Node.js.

```cpp
NODE_MODULE(addon, Init)
```

In the current N-API, it becomes a macro of N-API.

```cpp
NODE_MODULE(addon, Init)
```

Accordingly, this initialization function `Init` will be written in a different way. For example, it is written in two different ways in the feudal era and in the NAN era:

```cpp
// Feudal style
void Init(Local<Object> exports) {
    NODE_SET_METHOD(exports, "echo", Echo);
}

// NAN style
NAN_MODULE_INIT(Init)
{
    Nan::Set(
        target,
        Nan::New<String>("echo").ToLocalChecked(),
        Nan::GetFunction(Nan::New<v8::FunctionTemplate>(Echo)).ToLocalChecked());
}
```

The `Init` function should look like this when it comes to N-API:

```cpp
void Init(napi_env env, napi_value exports, napi_value module, void* priv)
{
    napi_status status;

    // Description constructs for setting exports
    napi_property_descriptor desc =
        { "echo", 0, Echo, 0, 0, 0, napi_default, 0 };

    // set "echo" into `module.exports`
    status = napi_define_properties(env, exports, 1, &desc);
}
```

<blockquote>

`napi_property_descriptor` is a description structure for setting object properties, which is declared as follows:

```cpp
typedef struct {
  const char* utf8name;
  napi_value name;

  napi_callback method;
  napi_callback getter;
  napi_callback setter;
  napi_value value;

  napi_property_attributes attributes;
  void* data;
} napi_property_descriptor;
```

> So the desc in the `Init` function above means that something called "echo" is set under the object to be installed, the function is `Echo`, all the other `getters`, `setters`, and so on are empty pointers, and the property is `napi_default`.

</blockquote>

### Declare Functions

Do you remember the two previous function declarations? Move over for the third time:

```cpp
Handle<Value> Echo(const Arguments& args);    // 0.10.x
void Echo(FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args); // 6.x
```

In N-API, you no longer need to have a `C++` background, `C` is sufficient. Because in N-API, declaring an Echo looks like this:

```c
napi_value Echo(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info)
{
    napi_status status;

    size_t argc = 1;
    napi_value argv[1];
    status = napi_get_cb_info(env, info, &argc, argv, 0, 0);
    if(status != napi_ok || argc < 1)
    {
        napi_throw_type_error(env, "Wrong number of arguments");
        return 0; // `napi_value` is actually a pointer, returning a null pointer means no return value.
    }

    return argv[0];
}

```

Step-by-step analysis of the above code:

- `napi_get_cb_info` Gets information about the parameters of the current function request, including the number of parameters and their bodies (which are represented as an array of napi_value).
- To see if there is an error in the call (status is not equal to napi_ok) or if the number of parameters is less than 1.
  - If there is an error in the call or the number of arguments is less than 1, an error object is thrown at the JavaScript level via `napi_throw_type_error` and returned.
  - Proceed if there are no errors.
- Returns `argv[0]`, the first argument

## Conclusion

This session explains the change in approach to native C++ module development in the Node.js:

- From node-waf to node-gyp, it's a change in build tools, maybe GN or something else in the future.
- From code-breaking to the advent of NAN, the Node.js community has seen its fair share of loves and hates, all the way to the new kid on the block, N-API, which has brought new blood into the development of native C++ modules.

I hope this helps you understand the sour history of Node.js native module development, and the reasons and background for the emergence of N-API.
