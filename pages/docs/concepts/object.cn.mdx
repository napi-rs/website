# Object

`Object` is very easy to confuse with the use of `Class`. Unlike `Class` you can't assign `function` or `method` to `Object`.

```rust filename="lib.rs"
#[napi(object)]
pub struct Pet {
  pub name: String,
  pub kind: u32,
}
```

Any `impl` block of this `struct` will not affect the JavaScript `Object`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  If you want to convert a Rust `struct` into JavaScript `Object` using
  `#[napi(object)]` attribute, you need to mark all of its fields as `pub`.
</Callout>

Once `struct` is marked as `#[napi(object)]`, you can use it as a function argument type or return type.

```rust filename="lib.rs"
#[napi(object)]
pub struct Pet {
  pub name: String,
  pub kind: u32,
}

#[napi]
fn print_pet(pet: Pet) {
  println!("{}", pet.name);
}

#[napi]
fn create_cat() -> Pet {
  Pet {
    name: "cat".to_string(),
    kind: 1,
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The JavaScript Object passed in or returned from Rust is cloned. This means
  any mutation on JavaScript `Object` will not affect the original Rust
  `struct`. And any mutation on Rust `struct` will not affect the JavaScript
  `Object` either.
</Callout>
