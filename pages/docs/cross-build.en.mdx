# Cross compilation your NAPI-RS package

**NAPI-RS** is aiming to provide a complete solution for building Node.js native addons, especially for enterprise users.

For the open-source projects on GitHub, **NAPI-RS** provided out-of-box CI/CD support for building and publishing prebuilt binaries for Windows, Linux macOS and FreeBSD with the release of **NAPI-RS**. There are also many users who are using self-hosted CI and want to build native addons for multiple platforms on a single system (mostly Linux). **NAPI-RS** provides a solution for this use case.

There is a [demo project](https://github.com/napi-rs/cross-build) for those users who want to build multi-platform addons on a single system. The CI of this project builds **NAPI-RS** packages on a GitHub Linux CI, and produces addons for the following platform:

- Windows x64
- Windows x86
- Windows arm64
- macOS x64
- macOS arm64
- Linux x64 gnu (`glibc` 2.17)
- Linux x64 musl
- Linux arm64 gnu (`glibc` 2.17)
- Linux arm64 musl
- Linux powerpc64le gnu (`glibc` 2.17)
- Linux s390x gnu (`glibc` 2.17)
- Linux armv7 gnueabihf
- Android arm64
- Android armv7

If you are building NAPI-RS packages with self-hosted Linux CI, you should install the following toolchain to build the addons for the above platforms:

- `Rust` toolchain, including `Cargo`, `rustup` and your target rust std. eg: `rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin`.

* [`llvm`](https://apt.llvm.org/). The latest _qualification_ version is recommended.
* [`cargo-xwin`](https://github.com/messense/cargo-xwin) if you want to build for Windows on the non Windows system. `cargo install cargo-xwin`.
* [`cargo-zigbuild`](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild) if you want to build for Linux musl targets. `cargo install cargo-zigbuild`.

## Host platform support

Integrating and properly configuring cross-platform compilation toolchain in the open source community can be very tedious and labor-intensive. Understanding these compilation parameters and resolving potential bugs can be very time-consuming and difficult to test.
Special thanks for our team member [@messense](https://github.com/messense) who has been working on `cargo-xwin` and `cargo-zigbuild` which is enabled us to build Windows native addons on non-Windows systems.

If you are using **NAPI-RS** in your company, please consider sponsoring our team to support the development of NAPI-RS. We will be very grateful for your support.
