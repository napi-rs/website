# Comparison with neon

[neon](https://neon-bindings.com/) is the other rust crate which provide great development experience and high performance.

{/* Neon 有一个成熟的基于 v8 API 的实现和一个未完成的 N-API 实现，只看 N-API 这一层面的实现，napi-rs 与 neon 也有许多不同的地方 */}

`neon` has a v8 backend and an incomplete napi backend. Looking only at the N-API backend, there are also many differences between `napi-rs` and `neon`.

## Abstract level

`neon` has 2 backends and it tries to abstract over the 2 different API's.
`napi-rs` is lighter and the API is closer in concept to the original N-API.

## Tools

`neon` has a simple cli tool which could help you to build/create packages in local.

`@napi-rs/cli` does more things like managing your binary cross local environment and CI, helping you publish packages in **GitHub Actions** painlessly.
