## Configuration

napi configuration has been changed, the `name` field is now `binaryName`.

### `napi.name` -> `napi.binaryName`

```diff filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "@napi-rs/package-template",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "napi": {
-   "name": "my-package",
+   "binaryName": "my-package",
  }
}
```

### `napi.triples -> napi.targets`

`triples` config has been removed, and you need to set `targets` instead.

The `triples.default` before are:

```
"x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
"x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
"x86_64-apple-darwin"
```

Now you need to add them into the `targets` config.

```diff filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "@napi-rs/package-template",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "napi": {
-   "triples": {
-     "default": true,
-     "additional": [
-      "aarch64-apple-darwin",
-      "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl",
-      "aarch64-unknown-linux-musl"
-    ]
-   }
+   "targets": [
+     "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",
+     "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc",
+     "x86_64-apple-darwin",
+     "aarch64-apple-darwin",
+     "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl",
+     "aarch64-unknown-linux-musl"
+   ]
  }
}
```

## Cli breaking changes

Cli has been rewritten.

`--cargo-cwd` is removed, you need to use `--manifest-path` combined with the `--manifest-path` to point the `Cargo.toml` path:

```diff
- napi build --cargo-cwd ./crates/napi
+ napi build --manifest-path ./crates/napi/Cargo.toml
```

Previous, the flags in `napi build` are relative to the `--cargo-cwd || process.cwd()`, now, they are relative to the `--cwd || process.cwd()` path.

### `create-npm-dir` is renamed to `create-npm-dirs`

See the [**create-npm-dirs**](/docs/cli/create-npm-dirs) for more details.

Besides the command name and flags changes, it's not recommended to commit all `npm/*` files anymore, you can use the `napi create-npm-dirs` to create the `npm/` files in the CI, like this: https://github.com/napi-rs/package-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yml#L358

### `napi universal` is renamed to `napi universalize`

See the [**universalize**](/docs/cli/universalize) for more details.

## `napi` crate

### Some JsValues are now behind the `compat-mode` feature flag

There is the full list of these values:

- `JsObject`
- `JsFunction`
- `JsNull`
- `JsBoolean`
- `JsUndefined`
- `JsBuffer`
- `JsBufferView`
- `JsArrayBuffer`
- `JsArrayBufferView`
- `JsTypedArray`
- `JsBigint`
- `Ref`

These APIs are not safe; see [**Lifetime in V3**](/blog/announce-v3#lifetime) for more details.

If you are using these APIs, you need to enable the `compat-mode` feature flag, but it's not recommended.

You can migrate these APIs to the new APIs, See [Values](/docs/concepts/values), [Function](/docs/concepts/function), [Reference](/docs/concepts/reference) and [TypedArray](/docs/concepts/typed-array) for more details.

### `ThreadsafeFunction`

[`ThreadsafeFunction`](/docs/concepts/threadsafe-function) has been totally rewritten. See [**ThreadsafeFunction in V3**](/blog/announce-v3#threadsafefunction) for the background.

The new API doc is here: [`ThreadsafeFunction`](/docs/concepts/threadsafe-function)

### `napi::module_init` was moved into `napi_derive::module_init`

This is due to the upstream [`ctor`](https://github.com/mmastrac/rust-ctor) crate breaking changes.

## `napi_derive` crate

### new `#[napi(module_exports)]`

This is aim for replace the `#[module_exports]` macro in the `compat-mode`, now you can remove the `compat-mode` feature in `napi-derive` and only use modern `#[napi]` macros.
