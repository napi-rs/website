## The Nature of Native Modules

Let's start with the most essential C++ module development for Node.js. For example, we have a legitimate native module `pinyin.linux-x64-gnu.node` under Linux, which is actually a binary file that couldn't be seen properly in a text editor, until we came across the binary viewer.

The sharp-eyed reader will see that its Magic Number[^1] is `0x7F454C46` and the ASCII code it presses is ELF, so the answer is obvious: it is a **_DLL_** file for Linux.

In fact, not just on Linux. When a C++ module of Node.js is compiled under OSX, you get a DLL with the suffix `*.node` which is essentially `*.dylib`, and under Windows, you get a DLL with the suffix `*.node` which is essentially `*.dll`.

Such a module, when required in Node.js, is required via `process.dlopen()`. Let's take a look at the DLOpen[^2] function in Node.js [v10.23.0](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v10.23.0/src/node.cc#L1232):

```cpp
// DLOpen is process.dlopen(module, filename, flags).
void DLOpen(const FunctionCallbackInfo<Value>& args) {
  Environment* env = Environment::GetCurrent(args);
  auto context = env->context();

  Local<Object> module;
  Local<Object> exports;
  Local<Value> exports_v;
  // initialize `module`, `module.exports` values
  if (!args[0]->ToObject(context).ToLocal(&module) ||
      // this line is equal to `exports = module.exports`
      !module->Get(context, env->exports_string()).ToLocal(&exports_v) ||
      !exports_v->ToObject(context).ToLocal(&exports)) {
    return;  // Exception pending.
  }

  node::Utf8Value filename(env->isolate(), args[1]);  // Cast
  DLib dlib(*filename, flags);
  bool is_opened = dlib.Open();

  node_module* const mp = static_cast<node_module*>(
      uv_key_get(&thread_local_modpending));
  uv_key_set(&thread_local_modpending, nullptr);

  ...

  // transfer the handle in dynamic lib to the `mp`
  mp->nm_dso_handle = dlib.handle_;
  mp->nm_link = modlist_addon;
  modlist_addon = mp;

  if (mp->nm_context_register_func != nullptr) {
    mp->nm_context_register_func(exports, module, context, mp->nm_priv);
  } else if (mp->nm_register_func != nullptr) {
    mp->nm_register_func(exports, module, mp->nm_priv);
  } else {
    dlib.Close();
    env->ThrowError("Module has no declared entry point.");
    return;
  }

}
```

Logically, the loading process actually looks like this.

- Load the link library via `uv_dlopen`.
- Hook the loaded library into the native module chain table.
- Initialize the module with `mp->nm_register_func()`, and get the module and module.exports that are there.

The flow down is similar to this flowchart:

## How to build native module

### `node-waf`

Before Node.js 0.8, developers used the `node-waf` to build their library. Of course the `node-waf` is not the node-waf in npm registry, the original `node-waf` has been fallen to disrepair for years.

This thing was configured with a file named `wscript`. From Node.js 0.8, it had `node-gyp` builtin, so people didn't need wscript anymore.

But because this temporary shortage, many libraries using C++ to build Node.js addon contains both `binding.gyp` and `wscript` in that time.

You can see files back to that age in this library [node-mysql-libmysqlclient](https://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/tree/9545ea7485fcc8b07b7c56c5ec3575938bfd4e5f). For node-gyp support it had `binding.gyp` and still preserved the `wscript` file.

### `node-gyp`

This stuff It has been with Node.js since Node.js v0.8, before that its default compilation helper package was `node-waf`(see below), which should be familiar to old Noder.

#### `GYP`

`node-gyp` is based on `GYP`[^3]. It recognizes the `binding.gyp`[^4] file in a package or project, and then generates compilable projects for each system based on that configuration file, such as **Visual Studio project files (\*.sln, etc.)** for Windows and Makefiles for Unix. `node-gyp` can also invoke system compilation tools (such as GCC) to compile the project to a final DLL \*.node file.

> As you can see from the above description, compiling C++ native modules on Windows relies on Visual Studio, which is why you will need to have Visual Studio pre-installed to install some Node.js packages. <br/>
> In fact, for users who don't need Visual Studio, it's not necessary, since node-gyp only relies on its compiler, not the IDE. Those who want to streamline the installation can visit [https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/7/5f7acaeb-8363-451f-9425-68a90f98b238/visualcppbuildtools_full.exe](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/7/5f7acaeb-8363-451f-9425-68a90f98b238/visualcppbuildtools_full.exe) directly. cpp-build-tools Download the Visual CPP Build Tools installation, or install it from the `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` command line to get the compilation tools you deserve.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at the basic structure of `binding.gyp`:

```text filename="binding.gyp"
{
  "targets": [{
    "target_name": "addon1",
    "sources": [ "1/addon.cc", "1/myobject.cc" ]
  }, {
    "target_name": "addon2",
    "sources": [ "2/addon.cc", "2/myobject.cc" ]
  }, {
    "target_name": "addon3",
    "sources": [ "3/addon.cc", "3/myobject.cc" ]
  }, {
    "target_name": "addon4",
    "sources": [ "4/addon.cc", "4/myobject.cc" ]
  }]
}
```

This configuration tells the following story:

- Four C++ native modules are defined.
- The source code for each module is **\*.addon.cc** and **\*.myobject.cc**, respectively.
- The names of the four modules are **addon1** to **addon4**.
- The hidden story: These modules exist in **build/Release/addon\*.node** after compiling.

For more information on the GYP configuration file, you can go to the official documentation, which has a link to GYP in a footnote.

#### Something more in `node-gyp`

In addition to being GYP-based itself, node-gyp does a few extra things. First of all, when we compile a C++ native extension, it goes to the specified directory (usually `~/.node-gyp`) and searches for our current version of Node.js headers and statically linked libraries, and if they don't exist, it feverishly goes to the Node.js website to download them.

This is a directory structure for the specific version of Node.js headers and libraries downloaded from node-gyp on macOS:

```text
/Users/napi-rs/.node-gyp
└── 14.15.1
    └── include
        └── node
            ├── common.gypi
            ├── config.gypi
            ├── cppgc
            ├── js_native_api.h
            ├── js_native_api_types.h
            ├── libplatform
            ├── node.h
            ├── node_api.h
            ├── node_api_types.h
            ├── node_buffer.h
            ├── node_object_wrap.h
            ├── node_version.h
            ├── openssl
            ├── uv
            ├── uv.h
            ├── v8-fast-api-calls.h
            ├── v8-internal.h
            ├── v8-platform.h
            ├── v8-profiler.h
            ├── v8-util.h
            ├── v8-value-serializer-version.h
            ├── v8-version-string.h
            ├── v8-version.h
            ├── v8-wasm-trap-handler-posix.h
            ├── v8-wasm-trap-handler-win.h
            ├── v8.h
            └── v8config.h
```

This header directory will be merged into our `binding.gyp` in the form of an `"include_dirs"` field when `node-gyp` is compiled; in short, all the headers can be `#include` directly.

node-gyp is a command line program that can be run directly from `$ node-gyp` after installation. It has some subcommands for you to use.

- `$ node-gyp configure`: generates project files, such as Makefiles, from binding.gyp in the current directory.
- `$ node-gyp build`: build and compile the current project, which must be preceded by `configure`.
- `$ node-gyp clean`: cleans the resulting build files and output directories, in other words, cleans the directories.
- `$ node-gyp rebuild`: This is equivalent to the execution of `clean`, `configure` and `build` in sequence.
- `$ node-gyp install`: Manually download the header files and library files of the current version of Node.js to the appropriate directory.

## Conclusion
