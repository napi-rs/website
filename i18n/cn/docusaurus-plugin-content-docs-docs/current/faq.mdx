## Build for `Linux alpine`

> https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/40113#issuecomment-323193341

You can not set compile `crate-type` to `cdylib` when compile target is `*-unknown-linux-musl` by default.

If you want to do so, you need pass `-C target-feature=-crt-static` to `rustc`.

There are two ways to pass this argument:

- Set `RUSTFLAGS` env, `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=-crt-static"`
- Set it in `.cargo/config.toml`:

  ```toml
  [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl]
  crt_static = false
  ```

## Build for `Windows i686`

There is `codegen` error when compile target is `i686-windows-*`: [Rust issue 67497](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/67497).

There is a workaround to avoid this issue:

- Set `lto` to false, if you haven't set lto in your `Cargo.toml`, the value is false by default, you can ignore this one.
- Set `codegen-units` to `32` (or bigger). The default value of `codegen-units` is `16` by default when compile target is release, you can set `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS=32` and `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO='false'` to make compiler happy when targeting `i686-windows-*`. Here is an [example](https://github.com/napi-rs/package-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/CI.yaml#L90).
